 Post Lab Exercise Challenge: The radio buttons for delivery choices in the app first appear unselected, which implies  that there is no default delivery choice. Change the radio buttons so that one of them (such as  nextday) is selected as the default when the radio buttons first appear. Find the appropriate  attribute to be used inside the RadioButton element in the xml file. You can accomplish this task  entirely in the layout file (better solution). As an alternative, you can write code in OrderActivity to select one of the radio buttons when the Activity first appears (onCreate). Submit the activity_order.xml and OrderActivity.java together with a screenshot  of your app.
